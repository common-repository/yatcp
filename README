# Translations:
  YATCP is currently translated into English, German, Russian, Hungarian and Spanish. 
  When you set up your WP to use one of these Languages that should be picked up automatically.
  
	If you want to provide another not present language just copy the .mo File in the i18n/ Directory
  and Wordpress should pick up the new Translation.
  
	If you do a new Translation please share it with others by sendng me the appropriate 
  files at <yatcp@organisiert.net>

# Misc:
  Daniel Kian Mc Kiernan provided adapted Versions of the YATCP Comments Files adapted for the
	use with the 'Edit Comments XT' Plugin. You can find them in the misc/ subdirectory. When you want
	to use YATCP and 'Edit Comments XT' just copy over the original Files with these.
